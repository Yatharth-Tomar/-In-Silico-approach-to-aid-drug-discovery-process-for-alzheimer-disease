This research study project aims to leverage computational techniques for data analysis and
machine learning models to identify potential drug candidates for Alzheimerâ€™s
disease (AD) efficiently by predicting the IC50 values of the target protein inhibitors.
The study primarily focuses on Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and
Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) as the target proteins for AD. A thorough QSAR
(Quantitative structure-activity relationship) study procedure was developed to
predict the IC50 values for inhibitors of each target protein. This procedure involved
collecting bioactivity data of the inhibitors from the ChEMBL database, eliminating
redundancy from the dataset, calculating descriptors, and building an efficient
machine-learning model to predict the IC50 value
